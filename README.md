# Biotech

This package is written as a part of my Bachelor-thesis and focuses on the needs of students.
Those needs are:
 
* cheap software
* high level of capability
* nice looking graphs 
* a high level of modifiability
* the ability to include their own functions

The usage of NVim-R by Jakson Alves de Aquino (https://github.com/jalvesaq/Nvim-R) or RStudio https://rstudio.com is highly recommended.
